- 👋 Hi, I’m Nico, aka @mewmewmewmewmewmewmew
- 👀 I’m interested in travel, soundscapes, generative art, and graffiti and 2000s aesthetics.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in object oriented prototyping through audio visualization and game mechanics
- 🌐 A fun fact about me: on top of knowledge in C#, I also speak 5 other non computer languages. If you feel up for a challenge DM me your guess of which ones you think they are ;)
